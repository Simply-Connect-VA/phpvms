It is a voluntary, not-for-profit organisation, that fulfills a role to provide a structured, hands-on educational environment for aspiring pilots using any flight sim there are no limits.</p>
          <p>I started this project on my small YouTube channel hoping to create a pressure free environment for all pilots. Please make sure you come join our discord for help <a href="https://discord.gg/p8dmube" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/p8dmube</a>.</p>
          <p>It is also a very active community where people can discuss aviation related matters, enjoy flight simulation and just generally have fun.</p>
          <p>If you are on the <abbr title="">IVAO</abbr> and <abbr title="">VATSIM</abbr> networks. Using our extensive fleet of aircraft, our pilots fly around the virtual world to hundreds of destinations in the world-famous red White And Black Aircraft.</p>
          <p>We offer all the benefits of being part of an online virtual airline community without the strict regulations, no entry exams and free to fly any aircraft within our fleet.To our pilots, our offer is to have fun, not a second job.</p>
